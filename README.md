# TheFlashGoomba
A project I did for my Computer Organization and Programming class! 

This project was initially inspired by what I consider the first game I ever created in 4th grade - The Flash Goomba. If you're curious, the link is here: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/238097836/

Because it was my first game, it holds a dear place in my heart, no matter how... interestingly programmed and executed it was. Thus, my Game Boy Advance project had to be a direct extension of it.

The gameplay is simple: you play as a Goomba, and you're trying to defeat Mario. Mario toggles between the left and right of the screen, throwing fireballs at you. Koopas roam across the screen, and you must try and dodge them. Your only hope is to place down forcefields to destroy items using the spacebar and run and jump using the arrow keys. This combines the elements of my old game into one chaotic set of mechanics. 

One of the fun elements I had to combat throughout the creation of this project was the tearing, or the pixels jittering. I was so used to updating the entire screen, as I had done in my prior game development cycles, that the tearing was unnatural; however, I learned quickly and with guidance from my professor that I should be updating the sprite only in VBlank and not the entire screen. This was a lovely low-level project that I had so much fun making, so I hope you enjoy!
